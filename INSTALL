  Preparation
  -----------

  The websms.com toolkit uses Jansson and libcurl, so you have to install the
  development packages for your distribution. You also need make and a compiler.

  For example, in Ubuntu, just execute following command:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev

  Installation
  ------------

  Just run the following two commands:

  make
  sudo make install

  The library and the header files will be installed under /usr/local/. You can
  change the destination by adding PREFIX to the install command:

  sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

  Uninstall
  ---------

  sudo make uninstall

  If you used a PREFIX for installation, you have to add it here too:

  sudo make PREFIX=/usr uninstall

  Other information
  -----------------

  The library was tested under Ubuntu 12.10, using libcurl 7.27 and
  Jansson 2.3.1.
